# VoltEase
 We created an EV 
wireless charging station that offers a special, 
original answer. Vehicles may charge on station 
without using external/physical connectors and 
any cables.  wireless 
charging is considered to be environment and 
user friendly as the wires and mechanical 
connectors and related infrastructure are not 
required.
